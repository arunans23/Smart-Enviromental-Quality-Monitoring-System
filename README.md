# SmartEnvironmentQualityProfileManager

INTRODUCTION

PROBLEM DOMAIN

Environment pollution is a growing thing and it is still an enormous endemic.  According to UNICEF, 300 million children breathe toxic air. Among the most dangerous pollutants are air particles known as PM2.5, which are a small fraction of the width of a human hair. They can be released from fossil fuel combustion and industry, and include natural sources like dust. The ultrafine particles enter the bloodstream through the lungs, worsening cardiac disease and increasing the risk of stroke and heart failure, in addition to causing severe respiratory problems, like asthma and pneumonia (1).

The people who are mostly affected are those people who have to work outdoors constantly, may or may not be travelling. Especially police officers who are on roads to guide the vehicles and pedestrians are more prone to environment pollution that is due to vehicle carbon emission. Also people who work at quarries and mines are suffered because of the dust particles. 

A proper system must be developed to monitor environment quality so that when the environment is harmful workers should not be allowed to work without proper protection or should not be allowed to work at all.


PRODUCT/ SYSTEM

The product will be a miniature, low-cost, accurate air quality sensor for detecting harmful particles in the air known as Particulate Matter (PM2.5) that would sense fine particles 2.5 microns in size and smaller that can enter into the lungs and cause irreversible damage. PM2.5 has emerged as the most harmful type of pollution for human health as cited by the EPA and WHO; it affects people with respiratory conditions, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmune disorders.
The device will be something that the average person could afford to buy, bring anywhere, and understand their immediate air quality in real-time. The device will be able to monitor and save a day long data and it should be possible to upload the data to a PC at the end of the day. 
The device will be equipped with a rechargeable battery so that it can be charged daily night.
